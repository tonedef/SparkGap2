# SparkGap2
This repo is for building the SparkGap2, a tube diode based overdrive guitar FX pedal, originally developed by Merlin Blencowe:
- [SparkGap2 design](https://valvewizard.co.uk/sparkgap.html)
- [Merlin's Website](https://www.valvewizard.co.uk/)
- [Merlin's Books](https://www.lulu.com/spotlight/valve_wizard)

I've yet to verify my own PCB (first release has errors, which are corrected). I will soon. Until then, this is what I've got. Feel free to contribute. Merlin's a great guy, and without a doubt in my mind the authority on valve designs.

His books have taught me a lot not just about vacuum tube amplifiers and linear power supplies, but electronics in general. I can honestly say he's thourghly responsible for the thousands of dollars I've spent to become the proud owner of the tons of copper and glass that's currently occupying about a third of my garage and music studio in various forms of audio projects - the SparkGap2 will soon be among them. Thanks Merlin for your genius and all the fun it continues to bring!
